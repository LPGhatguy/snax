# Snax: JSX-like for Rust
Snax is an implementation of a JSX-like grammar for Rust. You can use it as
part of the `snax` crate, which provides a complete, untyped DOM that's
quick to turn into a string.

If you're a proc macro author, you can also consume the `snax_syntax` to
produce whatever structures you need for your project. This can be used to
support a typed DOM or any React-like framework!

## Installation
Snax requires Rust 1.32 or newer.

It isn't published to crates.io yet, but you can use a Git dependency:

```toml
snax = { git = "https://github.com/LPGhatguy/snax.git" }
```

Some things are still a bit in flux, so I'm sorry in advance if I break
anything!

## Examples

### Simple Page
```rust
use snax::snax;

fn main() {
    let page_title = "Hello, world, from Snax!";

    let page = snax! {
        /* Snax supports regular multi-line Rust comments. */
        <html>
            <head>
                /*
                    Literal strings need to be quoted, unlike JSX.
                    This makes whitespace much more explicit, which is
                    useful!
                */
                <title>"Hello, Snax!"</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                /*
                    Snax supports embedding Rust expressions that return
                    `impl IntoIterator<HtmlContent>`. String and &str work
                    great here!
                */
                <h1>
                    { page_title }
                </h1>
            </body>
        </html>
    };

    // The result of the snax! macro is HtmlContent.
    // It implements Display and gives you compact HTML without a doctype!
    println!("<!doctype html>");
    println!("{}", page);
}
```

### Composition via functions
Snax is designed to work well when using functions to reuse pieces of HTML!

```rust
use snax::{snax, Fragment, HtmlContent};

fn user_widget<'a>(name: &'a str, age: u32) -> HtmlContent<'a> {
    snax! {
        <div class="user">
            { name } " is " { age.to_string() } " years old!"
        </div>
    }
}

fn users() -> HtmlContent<'static> {
    let users = vec![
        ("Gandalf", 34),
        ("Arwen Und√≥mie", 75),
        ("Primula Brandybuck", 133),
    ];

    snax! {
        <div class="users">
            { Fragment::new(users.iter().map(|(name, age)| user_widget(name, *age))) }
        </div>
    }
}
```
